History
The recent history of USC's involvement in the risk management and insurance industry started
during the fall semester of 2018. Shortly after the Risk Management minor and course became available 
to students, the Risk Management Society at USC (RMS), led by Megan Moore and Jasmine Klein (Class of 2020)
emerged as a student organization to help sustain interest in this field.

A year later, RMS officially chartered chapter of Gamma Iota Sigma (GIS), becoming the Gamma Omicron chapter
and the xth university of the GIS network. Described as the "insurance industry's premier collegiate talent 
pipeline," USC's involvement with GIS has opened the doors to many academic, scholarship, and professional 
opportunities [...] 

Despite our recent inception, the risk management program has continued to grow exponentially up to this
day with our members, both students and graduates, accepting offers at many reputable and prestigious firms.
